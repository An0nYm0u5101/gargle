Thanks,

Please omit the redundant "from R" in the title.

Please add a link to the google apis to the description field of your
DESCRIPTION file in the form
<http:...> or <https:...>
with angle brackets for auto-linking and no space after 'http:' and
'https:'

You write information messages to the console that cannot be easily
suppressed. It is more R like to generate objects that can be used to
extract the information a user is interested in, and then print() that
object. Instead of print()/cat() rather use message()/warning() if you
really have to write text to the console. (f.i.: token_fetch() )

Please provide small executable examples in all your exported functions'
Rd files to illustrate the use of the exported function but also enable
automatic testing.

Please fix and resubmit.
