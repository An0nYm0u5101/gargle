Thanks,

\dontrun{} is supposed to be used for examples which should not be
called by the user. Please replace \dontrun{} with \donttest{}.

You still write information messages to the console that cannot be
easily suppressed. Instead of print()/cat()/cat_line() rather use
message()/warning() if you really have to write text to the console.
(f.i.: token_fetch() )

Please rephrase the first sentence of the description.

Please fix and resubmit.
